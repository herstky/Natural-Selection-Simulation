<h1>Overview</h1>
The objective of this project is to explore the effectiveness of using genetic algorithms to train neural networks without the need for large data sets. The simulation consists of a 2D board populated with creature entities that are each controlled by their own neural network and food entities that give off a scent. I use a genetic algorithm and a variety of training scenarios to train the neural networks to seek out food based on the scents that they take as input. I designed the simulation with a focus on easing the process of creating different scenarios, so that the creatures can be trained with a focus on different things, such as avoiding walls, trying to beat other creatures to food, and reducing energy expenditure.
